This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(scales)
library(lattice)
library(MASS)
library(memisc)
library(RColorBrewer)
wines = read.csv("wineQualityWhites.csv")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
set.seed(20022012)
ggpairs(wines,
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", shape = I('.'))),
        upper = list(combo = wrap("box", outlier.shape = I('.'))))
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
```{r}
colors<-c("green", "lightyellow", "yellow", "orange", "orangered", "red", "darkred")
ggplot(aes(x=fixed.acidity, y = density, color = quality), data = wines) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlim(c(quantile(wines$fixed.acidity, 0.01), quantile(wines$fixed.acidity, 0.99))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=colors)

  
```
